# Attention

This project was done in an environment where it could run with SQL DB.
A SQL DB initialized with the correct settings is necessary for this project to run.

Maybe later I'll add instructions on how to create the DB for this project, but for now, don't expect it to work properly if you download it and try to run it.

At the same time, you are always more than welcome to look at the code and take inspiration
